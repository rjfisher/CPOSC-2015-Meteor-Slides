##  Why Meteor?

 * Universal JavaScript
 * Mobile & website
 * Reactive Rendering
 * Connected Client Operations
 * Hot Deploys
 * Coordinated Version Updates
 * Radically Less Code
 * Optimistic User Interface
 * Fully Integrated and Flexible

But what does that all really *mean?*

 note:
  **Universal JavaScript**:
  The same code runs from the client to the cloud, from packages to database APIs. The same code runs cross browsers and mobile devices via Meteor's unified Isobuild system.

  **Mobile & Website**:
  A great experience both as an installable iOS and Android app, and as a web app that loads on demand.

  **Reactive Rendering**:
  Client GUI components provide the look, feel and response of a thick client app using Meteor's Blaze framework or integrating with AngularJS and ReactJS.

  **Connected Client Operations**:
  Galaxy provides actionable metrics specific to the management of stateful Connected Client apps to ensure scale operations are understood and under control.

  **Hot Deploys**:
  Type one command to push your app into production and update all connected browsers and devices - even if your app is in the App Store.

  **Coordinated Version Updates**:
  Galaxy ensures the client code updates are coordinated with precision to ensure a seamless and automatic upgrade experience for all clients - even while using the app.

  **Radically Less Code**:
  Accomplish in 10 lines what would otherwise take 1000, thanks to a reactive programming model that extends all the way from the database to the user's screen.

  **Optimistic UI**:
  Meteor presents 'Data-on-the-wire' with latency compensation and conflict resolution built-in. When data changes, updates propagate reliably to affected clients and users’ screens update via Livequery, full stack DB drivers and mini database sources.

  **Fully Integrated and Flexible**:
  Meteor’s integrated stack means you don’t have to spend time managing and integrating components and code. You can focus on building your app. And with Meteor’s package system, you can plug in thousands of libraries with additional functionality.
